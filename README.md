# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Theoretical Summary
Introduction
State management in React Native involves handling data that changes over time, ensuring UI consistency and performance. As apps scale, managing state complexity becomes critical. This summary explores core concepts, challenges, and strategies to simplify state management.

Core Concepts
Component State (Local State)

Managed via useState or useReducer within individual components.

Ideal for UI-specific state (e.g., form inputs, modal visibility).

Context API

Provides global state across components without prop drilling.

Best for static or low-frequency updates (e.g., themes, user auth).

Third-Party Libraries

Redux: Predictable state container with a single source of truth (boilerplate-heavy).

MobX: Observable-based state management with minimal boilerplate.

Zustand/Jotai/Recoil: Lightweight alternatives for atomic or modular state.

Challenges
Prop Drilling

Passing state through multiple layers of components, leading to messy code.

Re-rendering

Unoptimized state updates causing unnecessary UI re-renders and performance hits.

Asynchronous State

Handling side effects (e.g., API calls) while maintaining state consistency.

Scalability

Ensuring state architecture remains maintainable as the app grows.

Simplification Strategies
Use Built-in React Hooks

Start with useState for local state; leverage useReducer for complex logic.

Combine Context + useReducer for medium-scale global state.

State Colocation

Keep state close to where itâ€™s used to minimize global dependencies.

Optimal Use of Context API

Split contexts by domain (e.g., AuthContext, SettingsContext) to avoid over-fetching.

Adopt Lightweight Libraries

Use Zustand or Jotai for granular state control without boilerplate.

Recoil for state derived from atoms (e.g., filtered lists).

State Normalization

Structure state like a database (e.g., using IDs for entities) to avoid duplication.

Best Practices
Memoization

Apply React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback to prevent redundant re-renders.

Modularize State Logic

Split state into slices (e.g., userSlice, cartSlice) for maintainability.

Selector Patterns

Derive computed state using selectors (e.g., Reduxâ€™s createSelector).

Avoid Over-Globalization

Reserve global state for truly app-wide data; keep other states local.

Summary
Effective state management in React Native hinges on balancing simplicity and scalability:

Small Apps: Built-in hooks (useState, useReducer) and Context API suffice.

Mid/Large Apps: Adopt libraries like Redux (predictability) or Zustand (simplicity).

Atomic State: Use Recoil/Jotai for fine-grained reactivity.

Prioritize colocation, normalization, and memoization to optimize performance. Choose tools based on app requirements, and avoid premature optimization. By structuring state thoughtfully, developers can reduce complexity and enhance maintainability in React Native apps.
